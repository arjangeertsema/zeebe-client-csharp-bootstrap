# Bootstrap extension for the C# Zeebe client

> This project is not maintained anymore and is deprecated. The reason for this decision is the resent fork of this project by [zeebe-client-csharp-accelerator](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-csharp-accelerator). Please switch to the [zeebe-client-csharp-accelerator](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-csharp-accelerator) which is a copy of this project with some small functional changes in the interface. Because of this switching should be relatively easy. 
>
> Apologies for the inconvenience but for the long term it will be better for the community to have one code base which is actively supported.

This project is an extension of the [C# Zeebe client project](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-csharp). Zeebe Job handlers are automaticly recognized and bootstrapped via a [.Net HostedService](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/multi-container-microservice-net-applications/background-tasks-with-ihostedservice).

Read the [Zeebe documentation](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/zeebe/zeebe-overview/) for more information about the Zeebe project.

## Requirements

* net standard 2.0 or higher, which means
    * .net core 2.1 or higher
    * or .net framework 4.7.1 or higher
* latest [C# Zeebe client release](https://www.nuget.org/packages/zb-client/)
* latest [Zeebe release](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/releases/)

## How to use

The Zeebe C# client bootstrap extension is available via nuget (https://www.nuget.org/packages/zb-client-bootstrap/).

See [examples] and [blog post](https://link.medium.com/4a3yax14gjb) for more information.

## Quick start

All classes which implement `IJobHandler<TJob>`, `IJobHandler<TJob, TResponse>`, `IAsyncJobHandler<TJob>` or `IAsyncJobHandler<TJob, TResponse>` are automaticly found, added to the service collection and autowired to Zeebe when you register this bootstrap project with the `IServiceCollection.BootstrapZeebe()` extension method.

The `BootstrapZeebe` method has two parameters:

1. `ZeebeBootstrapOptions` via [configuration, action delegate or both](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/options-library-authors).
1. An array with assemblies which will be scanned for job handlers.

```csharp
ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) => {
    services.BootstrapZeebe(
        hostContext.Configuration.GetSection("ZeebeBootstrap"),
        this.GetType().Assembly
    );
})
```

### Job

The job is an implementation of `AbstractJob`. By default the simple name of the job is mapped to BPMN task job type. Job types must be unique. The default job configuration can be overwritten with `AbstractJobAttribute` implementations, see [attributes] for more information.

```csharp
public class SimpleJob : AbstractJob
{
    public SimpleJob(IJob job) 
        : base(job)
    { 
        //Variable mapping logic can be added here.
    }
}
```

There is also a generic version `AbstractJob<TState>` which will automaticly deserialize job variables into a typed object. Each property is automaticly added to the `FetchVariables` collection when the `FetchVariablesAttribute` is not used.

```csharp
public class SimpleJob : AbstractJob<SimpleJobState>
{
    public SimpleJob(IJob job, SimpleJobState state) 
        : base(job, state)
    {  }
}

public class SimpleJobState
{
    public bool Test { get; set; }
}
```



### Job handler

The job handler is an implementation of `IJobHandler<TJob>`, `IJobHandler<TJob, TResponse>`, `IAsyncJobHandler<TJob>` or `IAsyncJobHandler<TJob, TResponse>`. Job handlers are automaticly added to the DI container, therefore you can use dependency injection inside the job handlers.  The default job handler configuration can be overwritten with `AbstractJobHandlerAttribute` implementations, see [attributes] for more information.


```csharp
public class SimpleJobHandler : IAsyncJobHandler<SimpleJob>
{
    public async Task HandleJob(SimpleJob job, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {  
        //TODO: make the handling idempotent.
        await Usecase.ExecuteAsync(cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

A handled job has three outcomes:

1. The job has been handled without exceptions: this will automaticly result in a `JobCompletedCommand` beeing send to the broker. The `TResponse` is automaticly serialized and added to the `JobCompletedCommand`.
1. An exception has been thrown while handling the job and the exception implements `AbstractJobException`: this wil automaticly result in a `ThrowErrorCommand` beeing send to the broker;
1. Any other exception will automaticly result in a `FailCommand` beeing send to the broker;

The `JobCompletedCommand` accepts variables which are added to process instance. For this use case the job handler can be use with a second generic parameter `IJobHandler<TJob, TResponse>`. The response is automaticly serialized.

```csharp
public class SimpleJobHandler : IAsyncJobHandler<SimpleJob, SimpleResponse>
{
    public async Task<SimpleResponse> HandleJob(SimpleJob job, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        //TODO: make the handling idempotent.
        var result = await Usecase.ExecuteAsync(cancellationToken);
        return new SimpleResponse(result);
    }
}
```


## Extensions

1. `IPublishMessageCommandStep3`, `ICreateProcessInstanceCommandStep3` and `ISetVariablesCommandStep1` are extended with the `State(object state)` method which uses the registered `IZeebeVariablesSerializer` service to automaticly serialize state and pass the result to the `Variables(string variables)` method.

## Conventions

This project uses the following conventions:

1. By default the simple name of the `AbstractJob` implementation is used to match the `Type` which is specified in the BPMN model. This can be overriden by adding the `JobTypeAttribute` to the `AbstractJob` implementation, see [attributes] for more information.
1. By default the assembly name which contains the job handler is used as the `Worker name`. This can be overriden by adding the `WorkerNameAttribute` to the `AbstractJob` implementation, see [attributes] for more information.
1. By default the job handlers are added to de DI container with a `Transient` service lifetime. This can be overriden by adding the `ServiceLifetimeAttribute` to the job handler, see [attributes] for more information.
1. By default the `ZeebeVariablesSerializer` is registered as the implementation for `IZeebeVariablesSerializer` which uses `System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer`. You can override this registration by registering your service after the `BootstrapZeebe` method or you can register `System.Text.Json.JsonSerializerOptions` to configure the `System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer`.
